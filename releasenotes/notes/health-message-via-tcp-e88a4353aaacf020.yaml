features:
  - |
    Added a feature to send larger health status messages via TCP,
    in order to avoid fragmented UDP messages which may not arrive at the
    receiver in some networks.
    The new configuration option heartbeat_use_tcp_threshold determines
    at what size of the message TCP will be chosen (-1 to never use TCP).
upgrade:
  - |
    There is a new option heartbeat_use_tcp_threshold to let amphorae send
    their heart beat messages via TCP if they exceed this threshold. 
    Set heartbeat_use_tcp_threshold to a positive value to enable this feature.
    Heart beat messages that are smaller than this value will still be sent
    via UDP, larger messages via TCP. If heartbeat_use_tcp_threshold is -1
    (default) TCP will never be used, so an octavia upgrade will not change
    the behavior unless you explicitly set heartbeat_use_tcp_threshold.
    To make use of the new feature you will need to rebuild the amphora image.
